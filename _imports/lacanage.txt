> Texts produced from materials obtained using Transformer [OpenAI's GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) language models trained on works by French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and my own texts. This is work is one half of a collaboration with Alan Cunningham, who entitled his mixture (his own texts and the same corpus by Lacan) 'A Lacking Text'. We are very grateful for the support of the [Art's Council of Northern Ireland](http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/) in 2020.
