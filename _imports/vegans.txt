> Texts reworked from materials obtained with [OpenAI's GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) or the [GPT-J-6B model](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/#GPT-J-6B) released by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) (both as is, no finetuning). The idea for this series was to start from a single prompt or prefix, with slight variations at times (delimited in each text by a star), and work on different narrative 'microverses' that are separate, even if many echoes can be found.
