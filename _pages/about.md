Jérémie C. Wenger is a writer from Switzerland. Apart from languages and literatures, both classical and modern, his interests lie in philosophy, music, and, more recently, (geo)politics and economics, albeit reluctantly so. His practice seeks to find a path away from sterile self-reference, inner conflicts and the bitter intricacies of exile, while attempting to forge a personal style and a renewed interplay between systematic thought and intuition. The discovery of computation and the integration of those techniques into his writing practice is an important event in Jérémie's trajectory, which could help develop some aspects of his former practice: an interest in constrained literary forms (inherited from the Oulipo and 20th century experimental music), as well as a strong personal and aesthetic connection with modernism.
