Jérémie C. Wenger is a writer from Switzerland. In 2018 he started integrating machine learning systems into his writing practice. His practice seeks to find a path away from sterile self-reference, inner conflicts and the intricacies of exile, while attempting to forge a personal style and a renewed interplay between systematic thought and intuition. Apart from languages and literatures, both classical and modern, with a particular focus on modernism, his interests lie in philosophy, music, and, more recently, (geo)politics and economics, albeit reluctantly so. The discovery of computation and the integration of those techniques into his writing practice is an important event in Jérémie's trajectory, which sheds a retrospective light on a long-standing interest in the dialectics between constraint and freedom in literary and artistic forms, especially in the novels and poetry of the twentieth-century avant-gardes, as well as in experimental musical composition.
