So weak resist resist in the past you did yeah not much but you did yeah at least that yeah that could be something. You did. That should be mentioned. And now. The same. And yet you still say it is the only way. You the same. The state the same. All that. The start of this one same thing, then the storm at the end of the day. The storm on the mountain. Blood, iron, simple. Many times so many times metaphors in my life -- was it was it all to get out of the rest? The constant rest. They say it is only a voice thing. A voice in my head. A voice down here. Under my fingertips. I mean, it is the thing yeah yet on the other hand no. There is no other hand. Only this one. The great one hand onto the surface. The good thing. (What?) The wall. All the same. Always the same.

The best of the old body (which is also the failure, all the time)

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

I can feel it the strong the fat the warped in the mind in the mouth in the fingers all the things that could be. All this. That was about to be. But then who what stopped it? The thinking? (I hate it when it does that.) Why on Earth would they want to stop the thinking? So unfair. I can tell you now. I was thinking about you. I think. Oh, no, wait, I don't, I don't, sorry. No thinking. That's right. I always forget. Haha. That's it. For today. That's it. This life, man. This crazy unthought life.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

I am this way. The problem of the mind the mind already back to the destruction destruction yeah the matter of my age, man, I know, I know you know. Destruction. Instead of something like a struggle a stagnation. So yesterday. Very clean transition by the way. The cake after the fudge. Unnatural, so be it. Biscuits better, whatever. The fingers the fingers scuttling rushing rats ratlings scurrying on the keys they know they know the difference the fucking difference the stupid fucking difference. They know it all. Not that it is the only thing, but still. It's a pretty big one. Already. A good start. Better than nothing. Unless of course it isn't one at all. A thing. A pretty thing. A big thing. Unless it, this, it all, is nothing. Unless indeed. Damned depression. Forever fudging. Forever fucking. Up, of course. Fucking you up. You know. Like your biscuits. Yeah, yeah. I know you know.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

I am the new ones. It is a problem of the positive and of pieces of the contrary. Not quite plural. Not quite dialectical. It is the experiment of it all. I am all those. And then I am the one who cares -- *swamp!* to the idea of the superficial to the first and foremost to the forms of control 'in the face of the universe' etc. A bit of that for a while (*if only!*). The struggle the contorsions the laughter.The near-laughter. Then *BAM!* the mechanism the mechanism of it all again the same thing the same thing. Again. Thought to be the only way. The same thing the pining the whining the real thing. If only the real thing. The shit thing rather. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Shit. Enough. Fuck. Shit. Haha. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. *Enough already!* Right.

Thus befalls one the constitution, as may have been subtly alluded to heretofore, of one's walls. Bricky labour. A fine routine indeed: one problem becomes that other one, as soon as piled. Once mortared, the lot becomes the rest. No sooner laid than *poof!* stern it becomes, thorny little one, cold and impassible, indistinguishable. Solved or unsolved, no matter, as it is, at last, one with the plane. Part of the whole, part of the wall. So much rubbish in this mouth. Under these fingers. Yet. Yet, it goes on. Block after block, the slow cobbling of it all. More of the same, it is said, produced the same, constituted the same, is to come. That is how it is augured to be going. Or (there is an or), or one argues the opposite, namely that the thing, problem, slab, real or shit, real and shit, remains the same thing. Singular and obdurate. Robust however minute. Docked there, for sure, yet still one. Unassimilated. Either that or the other. Foggy conclusion. It does blur the hell out of one, this sort of thing. This either or thing. Best of solvents. Better than wine, better than drugs. Beyond a doubt Dionysus approved. All of it so shifty one ends up wishing one had one's mind back. Assuming one had any in the first place. Or, at least, something approaching. One's state of mind perhaps?

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Ah, yes, the old problem. The mind-wall problem. All the time the idea the dream the *mare!* of a state of mind state of the mind state in the mind. Patrolling beating quashing the mess of the street. All the merry sounds of boots. Legions of this ilk in here, out there, thumping and thudding, everywhere, *swamp!* to the idea of the state -- although maybe maybe a bit less now less yeah in recent years less under me haha under this reign this dominion this indeterminate tenure of mine resist resist resist there is nothing else. Nothing. The mind is watching. Shut up. The state is listening. It is, it is, we know. Now shut up and resist.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Now? Nothing more. That as well. The old nothing. The nothing that happens. That keeps happening. Unfortunate development. That certainly was not the plan. The novel, rather, yes, the novel in the mind, in the idea, in the stuff. Everywhere. That was the plan. Yeah. I mean. Where else? The novel. In the heart. In the purpose. Up the arse. Oh yes. Down in the pit. Those hot things in the pit. Public servants, private slaves. Favorite sex tape. Whatever. Once more one does it. One cannot help oneself, it seems. Do stop one when one digresses. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Yet again. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Stop it. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Now. Such amounts of waste. Can it be made into cement somehow? Into oil? Haha. That would be fortunate. One more item on the 'must be tried' list. What is it I was thinking about already? Not as if I couldn't do that also. Thinking. I thought I'd mention this, in passing. But then. What could it have been? Who knows. How about the superficial constitutional walls of the state? Of mind? Haha. One is nuts and one knows it.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Sure sure there *could* be a spark a spark of this of that of hope of death fuck a spark of *something*. Part self-bashing and part void, part other and part same, yes, same same at the same time yes (why do you do this?) sad that now (of course one insists it is the point) now (all on purpose) sad that it must have been some head one's head a head of some sort its own tower entirely (not a problem for enthusiasts) as said sad that ought thus to have been thrust upon the world (so alien, so brutal) the world the world poor dirty old world its back bent by the weight of the arse of this totalitarian spirit hurled up from the bottom of space shit fuck crushed by the weight of the buttocks of that neuronal little turd cast straight out of the bottom the bottom the bottom of this or that dimension. (One does not say bottom, it is rude.)

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

In fact that is the thing, yeah, that whole thing that must be pondered, that entire affair that ought to be cerebrated, so far, as alluded to, etc, is not in the mind! As in, not *just!* in the mind. Despite all their whinging. No, not just in the mind, not just, say it again, in the mind, in the world not in the mind and that's that's yeah that's not the same. In the world. Out there. Not the same. In the world.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

However. When you are not yet, wallowing unwavering in your own unbecoming, or maybe when you sort of are, only not quite, because because (I do not know why, insert trivial reason, insert profound reason), then yes *then* it's not the things it's the words the problem (for once), the words the core the fruit the stone the fiend. The fuck fiend. (Oh shut up.)

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The thing is. Every once in a while it occurs that same thing happens to be both it and how to get out of it. Ouroboral, my dear Watson.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

This feeling of stagnation. The yesterday one. Pre-Armageddonic. I was thinking. Perhaps of interest to literature. Despite it all. Haha no. (You were not thinking.)

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The true problem of work. Or the other way around. Of true work. Whichever. That one. Remains. Yet on the other hand the other hand no. As said. There is no other hand. The problem of work, still there (the problem), still absent (the work), still so lame (both), despite the shaky basis of the high days of truth and the pressure for blood blood blood the dark the dark the self-self-self-destruction the browsing of the whole of oneself into oblivion. Not incorrectly put. A major hindrance. Who would have thought, even not so long ago? The context had been assessed. Conducive, favourable, optimal even. And yet no. It will have none of it. It remains.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The fleck. The fleck of the inferior one in the mud (cliché): bloated (surprising, but true), shambolic glory of the self (despite one's mind's best attempts at shamfastness), then (invariably) the back to the dead kind of thing (repetitive). That was the torturers typing, by the way. The old things they want written down (you would not believe). All it all expected to be a choice. The first single step out of the mind. The first one back in. Or the single last one. Any step. Misstep. Unstep. All on one, no excuse, no escape. Responsible, dependable, law-abiding one. The whole package. All on record, ensuring the appropriate sentence.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

No work no nothing. At least ancient wisdoms seem to persist. The least pleasant of them. This mulling over real and rear, crud and creed, greed and grit, locks and bollocks never seems to come to an end. Not many at this point could convincingly dismiss this pursuit, even unchanged, were it more, shall we say, *bullishly* striven for. As often happens, sheer violence, unhinged as it may be from truth and content, helps get the message through.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The ontic being-stuck-as-hell preceded escorted followed by *BAM!* the shit the shit hard tough going down left right up bloody shit up there at the top top of the skull top of the mind high above in psychotic heavens the same the same same going on on on the ground on the floor (*blood!*) under skins and calves far below feet and toes down down deep in the moor in the field (*lilacs galore!*) the same things up with the doves or down by the bones the same things up and down and left and right happening not happening constantly frivolously persistently. Indeed here we are down there up there all around lost stretched and loved broken cherished and quartered. (Was it an inch too much, and if so when?)

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

No change expected at the top of the inside of the skull of that piece of poop muck waste of a loser torn in the impossibility of either feeling the fuck out of the fucking stupid thing or, *the or again!*, drubbing the *Styx* out of that same fucking thing (that doesn't matter). Ergo something something videlicet something needed like a structure probably a blueprint a canvas possibly less an idea concept scheme construct right right *right!* I think I got it. Of course it could be a story. Or similar. Any manner of wrapping things up through which to reap recap (seen what I did there?) remap (too much) the most out of this decade of dispiration, toward some way or other of becoming something else, or the same, or something. Any at all (way and thing).

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

What now. Not again? One is afraid so. The black blurting in the head. One sees. Yeah. Obviously. Well yeah if you don't try don't blink don't do shit if you don't even move don't think you can even not think about it. *Touché*. At least have the decency of farting. Once in a while. A gesture of goodwill. When presented with such pressing predicament, is it not all too easy to resist? To the point. Fuck off not that again. One is told it is advised that from this moment on one ought to set oneself to it it the shit this shit that is the same. It as in. The old thing. The story. To refrain from uttering and get on with it. Understood. And keep to it for as long as conceivable, that is, as long as is required to obtain full certainty that the requested standards have been met. The only lapse officially allowed as per the customary protocol is the ingestion at least once per age or more if needed of a ration of food for thought in a manner, quantity and frequency that is deemed fit both by them, one and it, respectively, not neglecting the nonexistent assent and agency of the narrative object at hand (so to speak). So that at last one may recede and bounce back, to it, to their indifferent delight and one's unhelped despondency, with as much efficiency as is hoped will meet their expectations, in the steady incremements of the ingress into their version of the realization of it. Back and forth, in an ever so slightly spiral or pendular manœuvre. Reaching for. Before reeling again. Reaching out to this thing that is the same.

The hot-&-subtlety

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Self-torture is the strange thing and yet the story of the strong of this world. The whole thing you can't even start circumsepting (circummuring) was was was this was this a lack a lack of a lack of self-bashing? Or simply one's daily gust of disgust? Who has this thing called 'experience' in these matters? Senior impossibility-to-imagine consultant. One can sense a certain weakening of the page. (Can one ever not sense it?) I can remember the day my brain discovered and recess and collapse and loneliness and inferiority not omitting oodles of lesser lesser opportunities out there (you do not remember that). Things have progressed since then. In fetid, indefinable ways. Look at me today. What does not end up not to getting done within my week? One of uncountable changes. Then of course the pain the pain in the form of high nothingness low void (uncut thankfully) the pandæmonic siege to the Lorn Head Almighty (this shit's definitely uncut) the storm the wall the sameness the constitution etc. More on that, pretty please (*no!*). All right then (*no!*). The acid gashes the acrid pits the many towering principles of the desire disgust boredom for death for pain for joy might might all be drooled by the vapid books in the mind haha yes repeat repeat might might just haha no that's it that's all I'm done. I am not. I am. Stubborn rest. Callous nothing. Cancer fantasy. Strength pulsion. Lust for details. Or similar. *And similar!* All the while most likely the one (in my head) hoping fearing forgoing to reclaim something something more than this all this all those things that hold that keep the other (still in my head) strong and which the one must forget. Where when does this actually work? Haha. There must have been a time when the spirit of those attempts made off. Surprise. It didn't come back. Nothing did. Nothing. Rough estimate. Add that to the story. Add them. Be ruthless. The real bore. The tunnel. And the opposite. The clog. The wall. *And the rest!* The rest of it all (ever constant). Hence the progress of pain.

The dream the despair the inferior initiatives in this room room in the shadow of the stringent part of the shabby white of the walls of what after all after all is not (regrettably perhaps) the spectre of neither Giudecca nor Ponte City. Such as. A furious livid doing (if only) toward the getting forgetting misbegetting (something is the same here) of other subtle bits missing still missing (fair riddance). How about writing it? Predictable. But maybe not as much of a problem as writing about the room the street the spectres the production of days. Fine. Chop chop then. However preferably, if discretionarily, with style.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Ah. Series. One's dream of series. Pierre Soulages. Simon Hantaï. Francis Bacon. No. Not series. The dream is over. No. It is not over. It shan't ever be. The dream must go on. Even dead it will creep on. Dream of the deep. Underdream. It will slither on.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The text. The grey void that wanted to be. It all controlled from afar straight from the mind of the past haha from the other side of time where does that leave us *scil.* regarding self-loathing or lack thereof? Shit. Shit. Fuck. Shit. *This is the last time*. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Shit.

The world into some kind of curse. A bit like this really. Mirror for princes (*specula principum*), just without princes (*sed sine principibus*)("Off with their heads!!\") No bed of roses. I don't like it. At all. Yeah. At all. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing works. Nothing but the domination the brute strength bollocks no. Shut up. Not that either. The world is simply the same construct the same torture no more no less all those moments about walls about action about the same problem activities phrases poetry of the same of others poetry poetry of course. Those fucking fuckers. Their fucking world rubbish. Haha. Could not be more painful. What is more, this pain is not even the beginning (not the end either, not much at all, really). Of explanations, retributions, excommunications. Of anything. (The body the past language humanity the whole the parts the algebra etc.) Lost causes, can you smell it too? Better focus perhaps on the old retrograde path of stress (girls) the fuck are you even talking about?! Damn it. Focus instead on forcing yourself to feel the place of desire the place of void (abstract, official: better). Which is where great things (a well-known fact). Besides, it is all too obvious that the ability to grasp the lingering stench of the past (important) to the best of its abilities will come to this other one who holds onto the wall clasps the bedstead fucks off pops back clings again to the said and the unsaid. The great human straight from the diaries of life. Even if it must be said that the unfortunate state of affairs bringing about its (the human's) not ever budging (ever) has been nothing less than a line of hate. A red one. Such is the meandering way. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Such is the fucking diary way. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Do not think I did not come to think that this is not somehow important. I guess it might just be the effect of quantity. So much of this. This is but a bare extract. Cross-sectional slices, if you will. I am not in favour of the whole repetiton thing in the end I'd far rather have the discipline the discovery. Some would even dare say the fun. Haha. More like the freedom the disrepair in the cortex, if you ask me. The annoyances. The annulments. The paradoxically true things. The same applies for the intensity. Malorian quest for high level thereof. Oh yes. Ensue Graallessness, misdamselled distress, and other wondrous adventures. This is self-explanatory. You will agree that I don't have to prove that point. A pity it does not actually change overall sentiment. I hate it. This alleged only way. Not far (musing about this just now) from a complete system in fact, one possible meaning of 'technique', it all albeit at the same time the Morganian desire for the the opposite.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

It might be that the 'issue', if that is even the word, regarding the mind, is not about it being too old, as hammered so far, but perhaps, just as timely a diagnosis, it instead being too fat. Genetics (what should be thought) or complacency (what is thought), it is hard to say. Following the actual, not ideal, train of thought I guess I could add that it had it good that it reaped what it sowed. Still speaking about the mind. Yet another thing I hate. Somehow all of this a wannabe sophisticated obfuscation scheme for what is just careless smugness. (Appealing theory yet hard to endorse.) By an inch of course it could have struck the right tone, caught the right aspect. That, however, would have required another kind of terms. Another sort of truce. We know that this is the remains of the war. The long, fairly meaningless aftermath. Ever more convinced of it as I stare at the whole thing. As it stares back. For bodies agreed it is unlikely but when it comes to it can it be possible that the stare makes it fatter? Or just as a worsening factor? Even if in this state of disbelief still I should start keep stop thinking about it.

The fucking half-ugly thing

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

Now to the fingers. Are they not the ones who did not feel? The ones who started it? When the silence, the room, the war, the wall, were raging? Subjective creepers they are, who name this postmal point in time, climbing all the way up in the head to the great thing. That might be why I have it this way. Whichever way that is. Maybe that is what I should do. Maybe that could be something. A trail, a clue. The fingers as 'models', translate that into something. Together with the creeping on surfaces, 'progressive' (invasive, contagious) like in previous eras. I wonder. I wish I could say I am set to achieve some degree of insanity, just enough ("*N'est pas fou qui veut.*") to be able to expect some some some writing when at all possible (left left of course to the whims and outreach of the changelings of the positive and its significant others) about the roamings here and there in heart and head between the world that would be and the old one in the low of the bum. There isn't much mystery there, to be honest. Only one method: start from the start with the constraints of the art. There you go. With a bit of luck. Stick the fingers to the bottom of it. (Don't say bottom.) To the heart of the arse (one couldn't help oneself, could one?). Mind the circumstances, to an extent. That's it. Even if it could be the case that it is all far away I want to make clear things clearer one more time: the door is not the way. No way out. The fingers have known it for a while anyway, only you seem to struggle a bit. Anyway. Change please. Coming right up. Yeah. Something better. Yeah.

This language. Nothing made all. Some say not a problem not at all others the worst thing now the worst thing ever others yet complain or praise but to the perfunctory what-can-you-do-s add the only way the only way so far known to us them it mayhap in absolute terms not *the* one the *one* the one and only but without a doubt the only way *practicable*. If only lack could be made force. This lack. This force. The old mud and gold affair. The possible things you don't end up blurting. This all this all this shit. Any change in sight? No one knows. No one has anything to offer. Out of rumina like yours, gliding out on tongues like yours through teeth like yours out of snouts like yours words like yours are being disgorged. Mass-produced, industrial-strong, to an increasing (increasingly decentralised, increasingly automated) extent. No other words at all. Anywhere. In sight, that is. Our, their, its sight. For it would be irrational not to posit others. Somewhere. It knows where.

Assume there is a delusion around the margins of profit of contentment in and through lives amid plethorae of subspecies of girl swarms as well as philosophy. Assume that *a priori*. For survival purposes.

I am the most in desire for the same thing ('it or the beautiful') but I also try to be fodder for the dark as often as I can pleasing the brain of the end of the world (all too well) then on the contrary that's it again I can't I can't this whole wallowing the fingers the fingers run amok and this this stuff this shit the same thing the same thing. Anything else? My transformation incurred impediments as the posteriorating (nice try) as the abyss (not great) of it all grew to systemic importance. Which of course did not solve the problem of pain the problem of the pit. Interruptions in the revitalization effort. Erasure upon erasure. One kept happy remembering the basis for goals the eyes the massive stupid pure idea of the world (whining all the while). Then sometimes something inside a click and a few steps out and a bit further as if something like a better life the tilted forms a bench a door a couple of zucchini a fresh eel blurred cheeks birch barks on her arms beauty and more that is the point.

So what is it I want to start, if anything at all? An art of the positive for instance. Away from drab portents and the voices of the world wailing longing longer in the storm of 'additions' and 'corrections'.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

The conclusion is the trivial thing (they insist, one disagrees).

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

So maybe something something *goodness!* something productive more than before for a while at least especially as it was always clear in all this always always clear in all in all this all this all this all clear in all this that this entire 'you hate you' business is as as as shallow *swamp!* as the streets of Tono. Archaichally: a non-fucking-thirl.

You think you are going live. You don't see. You are not.

 

{% include separators.html type='outer' %}

 

You think you can get born but then you stop it. You won't even start anything anything else ever but the same romp from wall to room and back again as if in the storms of the tropics. Not even the start of the desire to be. Maybe next time there'll be more. More urge. More love.
