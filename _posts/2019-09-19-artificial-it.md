to begin with <!--more-->, that is, not only by the negative, for it is also, itself, the distasteful, but by, no, no, false start, one more idea, stupid, once more blurted, to the point where one would start asking, no, no, one does not ask, one does not begin, nothing here, seriously?, such a bore, yet again, can't believe it, no one can be that difficult, I mean, even within the wide realm of thought, let one keep it at that, that seems improbable, agreed, and by the way, small interlude, there will be many, it may well be just as difficult, yes, one says difficult, to obtain better men, even in quite a few more years, difficult, that is, be it internally or otherwise, ah, bloody one!, yes, you got it, got what?, that is the question, how?, even just one man, only one, if only, ah, one's own shit, begging for conclusions, one's keenness, excessive, to do anything, even some ill thing, some silly thing, some disillusive thing, no, no, adrift already, anyway, where was one?, excessive keenness, yes, hence, for sure, for something stupid, I make myself feel I can see much, where?, in there, haha, into the other, into the end, into cunts, into cum, yes, into these things, time &amp; cash, space &amp; sex, among others, for a while at least, haha, yes, after that only the wall, one wall, at least a nugget of wall, haha, even if some keep calling me back to my practice, and, for sure, WHAM!, I get it, my thing, my own, my nothing, such a nice word, almost transparent, therefore, since one is at it, so that it is clear once and for all, all this, the above, I consider it assimilated, and I tell myself, you might almost start thinking about taking notes, yes, almost, you might, not that you ought to, naturally, only in order to be the bigwigs you dream to be, what am I saying, in order to be the blocks which you dream said wigs be tossed on, it is now, chop chop!, dirty little blockers that you are, it is now that I would advise you to get down to it, and do also take note, in your hideous little notepads, that, for knowing the joys of another weakness of the same ilk as this one, that I may come to speak of further down the line, although that remains unlikely, I can confirm that if you are set on yearning for all that, silly old chaps, well, you can go on, hoping, that is, for hours, and this even if perchance you were to take the small yearns, and the small ones only, verily I say unto you, for hours and hours, to your fever's content, till whatever do you part, oh yes, true crux of the matter, alack, no, yet one more twist that is not strong, cut!, or not, one would cut it all, and to hell with that, true, after all, does one even want to cut it all, of course not, perhaps some day, not now, back to it then, back to what, to the wall, the wall, yes, the only way, go ahead, pig!, for it isn't as if you would want to take on but a whit of my my own private lot, isn't it?, oh yes, needle!, inverse!, you are the only one in this mess, don't expect them to join your fray any time soon, WHAM!, you tell it like it is, it must be quite something for those full-of-it-s to hear this, but poppycock aside, let one bring it to an end, the important thing is, stick it up your memory, in order to get there, where?, wherever, one can, it is possible, yes, absolutely, but not without wigs nor blocks, oh yes, oh no, that's right, something like that, good conclusion, standard, seamless, haha, this voice, this bloody voice, precisely this one, yes, the one that said, that was said to have said, regarding all this, something like, let one see, "de jure dead, he would have departed, on his merry way, yes, gone, no one would have known what had happened, pursuit of the best, of the worst, of the same, as always, no surprise, as mentioned, not to be unearthed again, rare certainty, burrowing for good in the tunnels, on the spumes of sewages happily floating ever after'', mayhap, mayhap, holy moly, what a story, yes, the best, the obvious, the trivial, yet infinitely better somehow than all this beauty, oh yes, all this beauty everywhere, slimy beauty, miry beauty, something along these lines, yes, oh yes, this then, whereof one speaks, this that finds its direction in and through practice, no, once again, it doesn't sound good, doesn't sound good enough, no big deal, one more setback, one more stumbling, there will be many, I would not be against it, that goes without saying, yes, against it stumbling?, never!, but then, then!, it must go all the way, let it stumble in full, not like here, not like now, as if, as if, truly a bad habit these repetitions, as if this was but the veil of that, you know this old affair, the copies, the second classes, whiny scum, that's what they were, yes, what they are, what they shall be, all these beauties, the old riffraff of stumblings, neither same nor other, neither better nor worse, yes, because one won't unstick me from my guns, the best is the best, as our tautologists holler, I could tell you a few stories about that, but no, back to it, back to it, write the voice, and the same voice to boot, yes, say something about it, as one does about the uses of disgust on the streets, between the legs, easy, all too easy, even if it will be as ugly as I am, it shan't be quite the same, but just as ugly, just as ugly, what is more, without forgetting that it won't help, one knows that, for, no, no for, to hell with the for, a simple jump will do, WHAM!, because of your path, what is one talking about?, you are safe one way or another, and because of mine, one guesses all that is left to one is a being as rock'n'roll as possible, oh yes, cunt!, rut!, fucking hall, given all that, it could at least be amplified, oh yes, what is sweat without sound?, speakers should be replaced, the people want a hall!, more than this recess at least, and they, the speaker makers, they can, but what is one talking about?, they could, if they wanted to, they and their path, they always can, they can ever more, amplify or reduce, repair or replace, at their pleasure, no doubt about that, but rest assured, there is no risk for it to happen, hovels will be hovels, busy as they are cutting out everything out there, we spoke about the cutting out, busy as they are chopping it all up finely, all the way down to silence, whereas amplified is what we need, so amplified, dream!, knout!, that at last it could be the hour where one hears oneself howling, in this nook, yes, WHAM!, well well, how come I loathe it all, I wonder sometimes, and by this point, mamma mia, scorched horizons of detestation, was it not specified in the programme?, in gilded letters, or iron, or lead, rare earth letters, free delivery!, thus it is to be pondered whether one should even take the time to start listening when it goes off again, "a predicament which led him to wish to think something about the dismantling nature of foam and its role in the multiplication of levities'', or similar matters, no, no, one must listen carefully, not give in to slouching, oh yes, faex!, urethra!, you at least understand me, curse!, shag!, truly there has never been a better time to fuck off, really, need one even say it, there is cunt in the air, hell yes, mouth!, tooth!, you try again, dirt!, you can't any more, you don't ever stop, oh yes, once more, ah, this, despite the efforts, again, how to go without saying?, how?, despite perplexities, despite this void, void that, a note in passing, could well be it, haha, this it, the it, no, yes, haha, the it to come, haha, the it one supposes for oneself, rightly or wrongly, what a lovely supposition one has here, I have come to the point where I can even ask you directly, do I suppose?, yes or no?, it is true, damn it!, and even in this implausible scenario, what would that be exactly, that which I am supposed to suppose?, after all, yes, plainly put please, what?, plonk!, tell us!, golly gosh!, yes, suppose that one may break out for instance?, out of the mud?, out of the pus?, pah, blessed with the old wit are we, you think that you've got the speck, of what it takes, for this, to suppose this, to break out of this, you think that, pretentious little it, well, think ahead, I won't be the one stopping you, certainly not me, him, they, on the other hand, most likely, he, they, would make you stop, that is certain, then they, he would make whatever you think stop, in the very instant, you can be sure of it, I saw them, I saw him, ask the bigwigs if you dare, whether you think it or not, in fact, haha, that's the beauty of it, in any case, break out!, dare!, be not!, all that, if one asks me, deep down it's only about some tiny thing, mundane and discreet, in the overall fumes, in the intensity, in the extreme, where everything ought to be, son!, bitch!, or not to be, time!, joint!, yes, heavy-handed one, all these muddy antinomies painstakingly to obtain, in a surreptitiously unthought way, insofar as it holds, that it may change, somehow, with the "but how'', "known refrain'', "critique of reason'', "forget it'' engineered until oblivion, the "&amp;c.'' on top, oily and creaky, kale!, to obtain that all this could at last be of no interest whatsoever, yes, if only, if only, all the wishes, WHAM!, one brief noticeable positive point, it looks like one swims here in the sludge of a sense of something quite entirely remote from the word "work'', good, one less bed for the strange fellows, riddance!, at this pace, ladle!, if it could be sustained, one would be done for, devil!, done for for good, all the way down to hope, haha, quagmire jacuzzi, what you would not do, swinelet!, for a few old things more, for a fistful of things, haha, what would I not do, now like in the worst of times, this one, that one, to exist, toiling as I am on the landfill of abstract literature, then, then, what to add to that?, some maintain, I collect, order of things, others simply go to hell, understood, and I for sure must reenlist, for Acheron's sake!, I hence proceed, I reenlist therefore I am, latest overbid on what shiny crumbs you, they, you all, bigwiggers, high-flying blockers, leave for me, lettuce!, each day another you, each night another crumb, each dawn one same it, one never ending it, but after all I don't complain, oh no, not at all, for let one not forget, pickle!, no work, no happy ending, of course, who would doubt that, quite the opposite of this, rather the reverse of that, the it, I sense it, shall lead, for good or ill, to the difficult end of the return into the sound of my project, whom would this not elate?, yes, into the sound of this cumming, of this chopping, cabbage!, into whatever the sound of this is, with as its inevitable conclusion the cell, the wall, the swamp at hand at last, El Fangoso, how deeply one yearns for that, cf. above &amp; below, at hand and gnawed until everyone leave, for the love of some random reason, ever reiterated, yet again, another megalomania hitting the market, truly, again, what a pity, buoy!, lassi!, same thing without the same thing, with the same thing, refucked and relashed, the sad thing, the same, oh yes, and this reading that does not work, what?, provisional aside, let one forget it, that is the word, yes, the word yes, haha, no, ugly, all ugly, at least ugly, that's the least one can say, the being and the not being ugly, no, no, these two again?, whence does that even come?, unbearable, ah, all this fucking, all this heaping, rope!, well, not exactly what I mean to say, as mentioned, let one pass over it all, let one try instead with the doing, the not doing, repeat after me, I'm doing it, I'm not doing it, today, tomorrow, that's it, carry on doing something, carry on meaning to, your turn now, for once, believe me, for real, it isn't that hard, to tell you the truth, you won't believe me, the more I think about it the more I think it is possible to think about it, crazy, isn't it?, thinking about it, and really, whatever they say, it remains possible, always possible, constantly coming back this twaddle, could I possibly be a twaddlist?, no, I won't, I'm not in, ever, I am no member, chuck all clubs!, halls and pits, down the drain!, with the bones, I know a few who are going to complain, but only a few, actually, yes, the few who don't matter, they can keep their being-toward-psychosis, that yes, oh yes, they will seek revenge, I know it, so much more pain, but so much more, vulva!, hinge!, so much fucking more, haha, as usual, yes, for years still, the years ahead, haha, one nearly reimagines said few, all these innermost ones, after the slaughter, telling themselves that he really was sad, like, deeply sad, in the deep end of the deeply, but of course it is simply a case of the deep end of the page not being enough upended, not going much awry, and of this never truly deep end, blighting bane, never quite deep, a little trouble of one's own, that can be felt in the moment of the day where the day is the day, as dumb as that, where it remains in the mind, in the heart, WHAM!, all the journey left, the voyage out, yes, out of the meta, or just out of the marmalade, ah, all these things that you would really want, that you want to change, and, for a change, my word, it, he, changes, I, you &amp; they too, therefore, yes, in some sense, yes, let one be bold, I, yes, he, am, is, haha, yes not like the few, at least that, at least that, repeat, so soothing, soon, where was one?, ah yes, quick, soon, yes, no, yes, no, definitely yes, stop it, carry on, voilà, here we are, the impure absolute, the perfect bucket, it, here, oft written in memory of some great name, for fun, for the tone, and it did happen, I can assure you, in this worst of moments, in this sort of never, the same as a few minutes ago, where never is never, this kind of stuff, more and more there's less and less, you get the idea, with at the same time, into the bargain, old marvel, this it over there, which should be something, which would be something, of course there is but it, only it for truth, for falsehood, wherein live labour lies, where it lives on until something, until what?, and after that, BANG!, one sets off again, one talks about it again, after what pretty please?, at times in writing it is good not to ask oneself too many questions, after that then he says, he says it all, firmly docked onto the need for self-making, for self-undoing, since the beginning it is like that, what climbs is, brother, yes, nothing to add, haha, here a prime delicate question for you, he's always been the best, incorrect, he could have been, no, no, he's wished it in any case, yes, bag!, refuse!, he only ever wanted that, that or the block maybe, that's it, the block, as hairy as it may be, or nothing, so much of this goes without saying, interesting, for real, to be continued, haha, that would be good, father fucking good, broth!, interesting indeed, but how?, all right, let one go, and do not worry, I'm trying, go!, how?, how

pour commencer, c'est à dire, non seulement par le négatif, car il est aussi, lui-même, le dégoûtant, mais par, non, non, faux départ, une idée de plus, idiote, encore une fois bredouillée, au point où on serait en droit de se demander si, non, non, on ne se demande pas, on ne commence pas, rien par ici, vraiment?, quel ennui, une fois encore, j'y crois pas, personne ne peut être difficile à ce point, je veux dire, même dans l'épais domaine de la pensée, restons-en là, plutôt improbable, on est d'accord, soit dit en passant, petite parenthèse, il y en aura beaucoup, il pourrait bien être tout aussi difficile, oui, on dit difficile, d'obtenir des hommes meilleurs, même d'ici à pas mal d'années, difficile, à savoir, que ce soit à l'interne ou ailleurs, ah, mon sanglant&nbsp;!, oui, tu l'as dit, comment&nbsp;?, c'est la question, comment&nbsp;?, même juste un homme, un seulement, si seulement, ah, les merdes à soi, suppliante à souhait, ses pulsions, excessives, à trop vouloir faire quelque chose, quelque chose de mal, de pas mal, de pas mal de travail, non, non, ça dérive déjà, bref, où en était-on&nbsp;?, à trop vouloir, oui, pour sûr, quelque chose de stupide, je me donne l'impression que je peux voir beaucoup, y voir beaucoup, où&nbsp;?, là&nbsp;!, haha, dans l'autre, dans la fin, dans la foune, dans le foutre, oui, dans ces choses, le temps &amp; les thunes, l'espace &amp; le sexe, entre autres, pour un temps du moins, haha, oui, après ça plus que le mur, un mur, au moins un peu de mur, haha, même si toujours certains me rappellent à ma pratique, et, pour sûr, BAM&nbsp;!, je l'obtiens, ma chose, la mienne, mon rien, un si beau mot, presque transparent, donc, puisqu'on y est, que ce soit clair une fois pour toute, tout cela, qui précède, je suppose que c'est acquis, et je me dis, vous pourriez presque commencer à penser à prendre des notes, oui, y penser, vous pourriez, non que vous deviez, naturellement, seulement, pour être les huiles que vous rêvez d'être, que dis-je, pour être les tubes dans lesquels vous rêvez que ruissellent lesdites huiles, c'est maintenant, tout de suite&nbsp;!, sales petits ruisseleurs du dimanche, c'est maintenant que je vous conseillerais de vous y mettre, et notez aussi, dans vos hideux petits calepins, que, pour connaître les joies d'un autre faible du même acabit que celui-ci, dont je viendrai peut-être à parler un peu plus loin, même si ça reste peu probable, je peux confirmer que si vous êtes décidé à rêver de tout ça, mes bons amis, eh bien, vous pouvez espérer, oh oui, pendant des heures, et ce même si d'aventure vous preniez les petits rêves, et les petits rêves seulement, en vérité je vous le dis, pendant des heures et des heures, ça vous mettra la fièvre, jusqu'à ce que quoi que ce soit vous sépare, oh oui, le cœur du dit problème, hélas, non, encore un tour qui n'est pas fort, coupez&nbsp;!, ou pas, on couperait tout, et puis merde, on n'a pas à aimer, c'est vrai après tout, est-ce qu'on veut tout couper, ça non, peut-être un jour, pas maintenant, revenons-y donc, à quoi, au mur, le mur, oui, c'est le seul moyen, vas-y, mon cochon&nbsp;!, parce que c'est pas comme si vous vouliez prendre sur vous ne serait-ce qu'un pet de ma propre ration privée, hein?, oh oui, ma seringue&nbsp;!, mon inverse&nbsp;!, t'es seul dans le pétrin, n'attends pas qu'ils entrent en lice, c'est pas demain la veille&nbsp;!, BAM&nbsp;!, comme tu y vas, ça doit être quelque chose pour ces gros pleins de trucs d'entrendre ça, mais billevesées à part, mettons-y un point final, l'essentiel est donc, souvenez-vous en, y arriver, où?, n'importe, on peut, c'est possible, oui, parfaitement, mais pas sans huiler, sans tuyauter, oh oui, oh non, c'est ça, quelque chose comme ça, belle conclusion, standarde, sans bavure, haha, cette voix, mais cette voix, précisément celle-là, oui, celle qui a dit, qui a été dite avoir dit, autour de tout cela, quelque chose comme, voyons voir, «&nbsp;en droit défunté, il s'en serait allé, par le chemin, oui, parti, personne n'aurait su ce qui était advenu, quête du meilleur, du pire, du même, comme toujours, sans surprise, comme mentionné, à jamais inexhumé, rare certitude, creusant pour de bon dans les tunnels, vécu heureux flottant sur l'écume des épurations&nbsp;», peut-être, peut-être, mon petit bonhomme, quelle histoire, oui, le meilleur, l'évident, le trivial, pourtant infiniment mieux en quelque sorte que tout ce beau, ah oui, toute cette beauté partout, beauté baveuse, beauté purulente, quelque chose dans ce genre, oui, ah oui, ça donc, dont on parle, ce qui trouve sa direction dans et par la pratique, non, une fois encore, ça ne sonne pas, ça ne sonne pas assez bien, pas un drame, encore un retour, un trébuchement, comme il y en a tant, je ne serais pas contre, cela va sans dire, oui, contre que ça trébuche&nbsp;?, jamais&nbsp;!, mais alors, alors&nbsp;!, ça doit y aller, que ça trébuche bien, pas comme ici, comme maintenant, comme si, comme si, décidément une sale habitude ces répétitions, comme si ceci n'était que le voile de cela, tu connais bien cette veille affaire, les copies, les secondes zones, chieuse racaille, voilà ce qu'elles étaient, oui, ce qu'elles sont, ce qu'elles seront, toutes ces beautés, la vieille canaille des titubements, ni même ni autre, ni meilleure ni pire, oui, parce qu'on ne me le fera pas dégorger, le meilleur c'est le meilleur, comme le beuglent nos tautologues, je pourrais vous en dire de belles à ce propos, mais non, revenons, revenons, écrire la voix, et la même voix avec ça, oui, en dire quelque chose, comme on écrit sur l'utilisation du dégoût dans les rues, entre les cuisses, facile, que trop facile, même si ce sera aussi laid que moi, non que ce soit vraiment pareil, mais tout aussi laid, tout aussi laid, sans oublier de surcroît que n'aidera pas, on le sait, car, non, pas de car, au diable le car, un simple saut ira, BAM&nbsp;!, à cause de votre chemin, de quoi on parle&nbsp;?, vous êtes sauf d'une manière ou d'une autre, et à cause du mien, on devine que tout ce qui me reste c'est de rester aussi rock'n'roll que possible, oh oui, mon con&nbsp;!, mon ornière&nbsp;!, putain de salle, après tout ça, ça pourrait être amplifié tout de même, oh oui, ça devrait, qu'est-ce que le son sans la sueur&nbsp;?, les amplis devraient être remplacés, le peuple veut une salle&nbsp;!, plus que ce réduit en tout cas, et eux, les faiseurs d'amplis, ils le peuvent, mais de quoi on parle&nbsp;?, ils le pourraient, s'ils le voulaient, eux et leur chemin, ils le peuvent toujours, ils peuvent toujours plus, amplifier ou réduire, réparer ou remplacer, à leur bon plaisir, aucun doute là-dessus, je vous le garantis, mais ça ne risque pas d'arriver, les taudis ont la vie dure, occupés qu'ils sont à couper tout ce qui est, couper on en a parlé, occupés qu'ils sont à hâcher tout ça menu, jusqu'au fin fond du silence, alors qu'amplifié, voilà ce qu'il nous faut, tellement amplifié, mon rêve&nbsp;!, mon knout&nbsp;!, que ça pourrait être enfin l'heure où on s'entend hurler, dans ce recoin, oui, BAM&nbsp;!, décidément, comment ça se fait que je déteste ça, je me demande parfois, et à ce stade, mamma mia, horizons brûlés de la détestation, n'était-ce pas pourtant indiqué sur le programme&nbsp;?, en lettres d'or, de fer, de plomb, lettres de terres rares, livraison gratuite&nbsp;!, du coup c'est à se demander s'il faut même prendre le temps de commencer à écouter quand ça repart, «&nbsp;un embarras qui le conduisit à souhaiter penser quelque chose à propos de la nature démantelante des bulles et leur rôle dans la multiplication des légèretés&nbsp;», ou choses du genre, non, non, il faut bien écouter, ne pas se relâcher, oh oui, ma fèce&nbsp;!, mon urêtre&nbsp;!, toi au moins tu me comprends, malepeste&nbsp;!, mon coït&nbsp;!, vraiment jamais il n'y eut meilleure occasion pour foutre le camp, vraiment, faut-il même prendre la peine de le formuler, il y a de la nique dans l'air, oh que oui, ma bouche&nbsp;!, ma dent&nbsp;!, tu recommences, saleté&nbsp;!, tu n'en peux plus, tu n'arrêtes pas, eh oui, une fois encore, ah ça, malgré les efforts, encore, comment aller de soi&nbsp;?, comment&nbsp;?, malgré les perplexités, malgré ce vide, vide qui, soit dit en passant, pourrait bien être ça, haha, ce ça, le ça, non, pas ça, haha, le ça à venir, haha, ce ça qu'on se suppose, à tort ou à raison, la belle supposition que voilà, j'en suis au point où je peux même te le demander, je suppose&nbsp;?, oui ou non&nbsp;?, c'est vrai ça, damnation&nbsp;!, et même dans ce scénario improbable, que serait-ce donc au juste&nbsp;?, ce que je serais censé supposer&nbsp;?, après tout, oui, en clair je t'en prie, quoi&nbsp;?, ma vinasse&nbsp;!, dis-nous&nbsp;!, saperlipopette&nbsp;!, oui, suppose qu'on parvienne à s'en sortir par exemple&nbsp;?, hors de la boue&nbsp;?, hors du pus&nbsp;?, bah, la vieille sortie que voilà, vous pensez que vous en avez un peu, de qu'il faut, pour ça, pour supposer ça, pour sortir de ça, vous le pensez, prétentieux petit ça, eh bien, pensez donc, ce n'est pas moi qui vais vous arrêter, certainement pas moi, lui peut-être, eux, sans doute, il vous ferait vous arrêtez, ils le feraient, c'est certain, puis il, ils, ferait arrêter tout ce que vous pensez, feraient, à l'instant même, vous pouvez en être sûr, je les ai vus, lui, demandez aux huiles si vous osez, que vous le pensiez ou non d'ailleurs, haha, c'est ça le plus beau, de toute façon, sortir&nbsp;!, oser&nbsp;!, ne pas être&nbsp;!, tout ça, si on me demande mon avis, il ne s'agit au fond que d'une petite chose, quelconque et discrète dans l'ensemble, dans les fumées générales, dans l'intensité, dans l'extrême, où tout devrait être, fils&nbsp;!, putain&nbsp;!, ou ne pas être, mon temps&nbsp;!, mes gonds&nbsp;!, oui, mon lourdingue, toutes ces antinomies vaseuses pour obtenir que, d'une façon subrepticement impensée, si tant est que ça se tienne, que ça puisse changer, en quelque sorte, avec les «&nbsp;mais comment&nbsp;», «&nbsp;chanson connue&nbsp;», «&nbsp;critique de la raison&nbsp;», «&nbsp;cours toujours&nbsp;» manigancés jusqu'à l'oubli, le «&nbsp;&amp;c.&nbsp;» en prime, huileux et croquant, mon chou kale&nbsp;!, pour obtenir que tout cela puisse être sans un quelconque intérêt, oui, si seulement, si seulement, tous les souhaits, BAM&nbsp;!, un point positif à souligner au passage, on dirait bien qu'on nage ici dans la vase d'un sens tout autre que celui du mot «&nbsp;travail&nbsp;», bien, toujours ça de pris sur l'ennemi, débarras&nbsp;!, à ce rythme, mon gaillard&nbsp;!, si ça pouvait se soutenir, c'en serait fait, diantre&nbsp;!, fait jusqu'à l'espoir, haha, jacuzzi du marasme, qu'est-ce que tu ne ferais pas, naine ordure&nbsp;!, pour quelques vieilles choses de plus, pour une poignées de trucs, haha, qu'est-ce que je ne ferais pas, maintenant comme dans le pire des temps, celui-ci, celui-là, pour exister, besognant comme je le fais dans la décharge de la littérature abstraite, puis, puis, qu'ajouter à cela&nbsp;!, certains maintiennent moi je reçois, ordre des choses, alors que les autres aillent chier, je dois rempiler pardi, je rempile donc, foutres de l'Achéron&nbsp;!, je rempile donc je suis, dernière surenchère en vogue sur ce que vous, vous autres, huileurs, tuyauteurs de grands chemins, me laissez comme miettes, ma laitue&nbsp;!, chaque jour un autre vous, chaque nuit une autre miette, chaque aurore un même ça, ça à n'en plus finir, mais après tout je ne me plains pas, oh que non, n'oublions pas, mon vinaigre&nbsp;!, pas de travail, pas de chocolat, bien sûr, qui en douterait, au contraire de ceci, à rebours de cela, le ça, je le sens, mènera bon an mal an à la fin difficile du retour dans le son de mon projet, qui ne s'en réjouirait&nbsp;?, oui, dans le son de ce foutre, de ce hachage, ma rave&nbsp;!, de quel que soit ce qu'est ce son, avec pour conclusion inévitable la cellule, le mur, le marais enfin atteints, El Fangoso, oh que je veux cela, cf. ci-dessus &amp; ci-dessous, atteints et rongés jusqu'à ce que tout le monde s'en aille, pour l'amour d'une raison quelconque, toujours recommencée, rebelote, une autre mégalomanie dans les bacs, vraiment, encore, quelle pitié, ma bouée&nbsp;!, mon lassi&nbsp;!, même chose sans la même chose, avec la même chose, refoutue et refouaillée, la chose triste, la même, oh oui, et ce lire qui ne fonctionne pas, comment&nbsp;?, aparté provisoire, oublions ça, c'est le mot, oui, le mot oui, haha, non, laid ça, tout laid, au moins laid, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire, hum, l'être et le ne pas être laid, non, non, ces deux-là encore&nbsp;?, d'où c'est donc que ça revient&nbsp;?, insupportable, ah, tout ce foutre, tout cet amas, ma corde&nbsp;!, bon, pas exactement que je veux dire, comme dit, passons, tentons plutôt avec le faire, le ne pas faire, répète après moi, je le fais, je ne le fais, aujourd'hui, demain, c'est ça, continuer à faire quelque chose, à faire comme si, à vous maintenant, pour une fois, croyez-moi, vraiment, ce n'est pas si difficile, pour tout vous dire, vous ne me croirez pas, plus j'y pense plus je pense qu'il est possible d'y penser, c'est fou quand même, quand j'y pense, et vraiment, quoi qu'ils en disent, ça reste possible, toujours possible, tout le temps ça revient ces fadaises, serais-je un fadaisiste&nbsp;?, non, je n'en serai pas, je ne suis pas membre, à bas les clubs&nbsp;!, les salles et les puits, aux chiottes&nbsp;!, avec les os, j'en connais qui se plaindront, en fait seulement quelques-uns, oui, les quelques-uns qui ne comptent pas, qu'ils le gardent leur être-pour-la-psychose, ça oui, oh oui, ils vont se venger je le sais, tellement plus de douleur, mais tellement plus, ma vulve&nbsp;!, ma charnière&nbsp;!, tellement putain de plus, haha, comme d'habitude, oui, encore pendant des années, les années devant soi, haha, on réimagine presque lesdits quelques-uns, tous ces fors intérieurs, après le massacre, se disant que quand même il était triste, genre vraiment triste, au fond du tréfond, mais bien sûr c'est d'un au fond de la page qu'il s'agit, un au fond pas assez chamboulé, que trop peu à vau-l'eau, et de ce jamais vraiment au fond non plus, maladif fléau, jamais tout à fait, petit ennui à soi, qui se sent dans le moment de la journée où le jour est le jour, tout connement, où il reste dans l'esprit, dans le cœur, BAM&nbsp;!, tout le chemin à faire, oui, hors du méta, ou juste hors de la mélasse, ah, toutes ces choses que tu veux vraiment, que tu veux changer, et pour changer, ma parole, ça, il, je change, eux aussi, donc, oui en quelque sorte oui, soyons audacieux, je, oui, il, suis, est, haha, oui pas comme les quelques-uns, au moins ça, au moins ça, répète, ça rassure, bientôt, où en était-ce&nbsp;?, ah oui, vite, bientôt, oui, non, oui, non, pour sûr oui, arrête, poursuis, voilà, on y est, c'est l'impur absolu, le parfait baquet, ça, ici, écrit souvent à la mémoire d'un grand nom, pour le fun, pour la musique, car c'est arrivé, je vous assure, dans ce pire des moments, dans cette sorte de jamais, le même que tout à l'heure, où le jamais est le jamais, ce genre de truc, de plus en plus il y a de moins en moins, tu vois l'idée, avec en même temps, par dessus le marché, vieille merveille, ce ça-là, qui devrait être quelque chose, qui serait quelque chose, bien sûr qu'il n'y a que ça, que ça de vrai, que ça de faux, tout ça, où réside le travail vivant, où ça vit jusqu'à quelque chose, jusqu'à quoi&nbsp;?, et après cela, et BOUM&nbsp;!, on repart, on en reparle, après quoi je vous en prie&nbsp;?, à certains moments de l'écriture il est bon de ne pas se poser trop de questions, après cela donc il dit, il dit tout, arrimé au besoin de se faire, de se défaire, depuis le début c'est comme ça, ce qui monte est, frère, oui, rien à ajouter, haha, pour une question délicate, c'en est une, il a toujours été le premier, inexact, il pourrait l'avoir été, non, non, l'avoir voulu en tout cas, oui, mon sac&nbsp;!, mon rebut&nbsp;!, il n'a jamais voulu que ça, ça ou les tubes peut-être, c'est ça, les tubes, bien huilé, sinon rien, sinon tout, bien sûr, toutes ces choses qui vont sans dire, intéressant, décidément, à poursuivre, haha, ce serait pas mal, putain de pas mal, hum, intéressant certes, mais comment&nbsp;?, allez viens, ne t'en fais pas, j'essaie, allez&nbsp;!, comment&nbsp;?, comment
